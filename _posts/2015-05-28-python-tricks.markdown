Been a long time since I've update the blog. I have been recently working on an Information Retrieval project. Along the way learned a few tricks 

1. [Using python's abc module to create abstract base classes and methods](https://docs.python.org/2/library/abc.html)
2. [Using click module for writing better command line scripts](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/click)
3. [Using lxml's iterparse method for speeding up parsing of a large XML file](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9856163/using-lxml-and-iterparse-to-parse-a-big-1gb-xml-file)
4. [Using os.linesep for writing to file the correct way](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6159900/correct-way-to-write-line-to-file-in-python)
5. [Using json.dump's indent method to pretty print JSON on terminal](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12943819/how-to-python-prettyprint-a-json-file)
6. [Using joblib's Memory decorator to memorize/cache partial results](https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/memory.html)
7. Using [blessings](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blessings) and [terminaltable](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/terminaltables/1.0.2) for pretty printing onto terminal

Good learning this week!
