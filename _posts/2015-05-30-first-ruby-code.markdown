Today I wrote my first actual Ruby code, I did play with it in past. Couple of comments from writing Ruby code

* Ruby felt easy to pickup given that I have worked with Python in Past
* Ruby's tooling is good. Also seems like they have a pretty active community for building and maintaining gems
* Ruby package's documentation are pretty good. I could work with [simple-rss](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/simple-rss/1.3.1) with ease.

I plan on creating a simple Rails application based on [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) that would allow you to create simple News Search site.
