Back in 2006 there was data leak from [AOL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_search_data_leak). Since then [dataset](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~dudek/206/Logs/AOL-user-ct-collection/) has been lived eternally on internet, which is a boon given that you don't easily get access to datasets anymore. Following are some interesting research on that front 

1. [How Google May Reform Queries Based On Co-Occurrence In Query Sessions](http://www.seobythesea.com/2013/09/google-reform-queries-based-co-occurrence-query-sessions/)
