This week I did some basic analysis on Jobs posting dataset. Along the way I learn few tricks 

1. [Use of compiler.ast for Flattening nested lists](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17338913/flatten-list-of-list-through-list-comprehension)
2. [Sorting dictionary by value using operator.itemgetter](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/613183/sort-a-python-dictionary-by-value)
3. [Using NLTK to generate Ngrams](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17531684/n-grams-in-python-four-five-six-grams)
4. [Using Counters from collections](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19883015/python-collections-counter-vs-defaultdictint)

Using these in combination not only reduce code size, made code more readable.
