This week I was researching on creating a simple server that will run on RaspberryPi and display some images & videos. I learned the following 

1. [Using ConfigParser as replacement to .ini files](http://pymotw.com/2/ConfigParser/index.html)
2. [Pythonic interface to Arduino](http://playground.arduino.cc/Interfacing/Python)
3. [Using codecs for encoding/decoding e.g. ROT13](https://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html)
4. [Using heapq for priority queue implementation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html)

heapq can be combined with multiprocessing to do priority based works.
